 Like the previous types you'vs read about, such as Int or String, when you create a collection,
 you must declare it as either a constant or a variable.
 
 If you donÂ´t need the collection change, add or remove items then you should declare it as a
 constant with let. Alternatively, if you need to add, remove or update values in the collection,
 you should create a mutable collection by declaring it as a variable with var.

 ARRAY
 An array is an ordered collection of values of the same type. Thye elements in the array are
