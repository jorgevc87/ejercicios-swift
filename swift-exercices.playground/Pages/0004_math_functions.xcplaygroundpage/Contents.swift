/*
 Swift also has a vast range of math functions for you to use when necessary. You never know when you
 need to pull out some trigonometry, especially when you`re a pro at Swift and writing those complex
 games.
 
 NOTE: Not all of these functions are part of Swift. The operating system provides some. Don`t
 remove the import statement that comes as part of the playground template or Xcode will tell you
 it can`t find these functions.
