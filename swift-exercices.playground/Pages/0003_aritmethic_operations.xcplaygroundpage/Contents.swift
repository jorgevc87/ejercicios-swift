/*
 When you take one or more pieces of data and turn into another piece of data,
 this is known as an operation.
 The simplest way to understand operations is to think about aritmethic. The
 addition operation takes two numbers and converts them into the sum of the two
 numbers. The substraction operation takes two numbers and converts them into the
 difference between the two numbers.
 
 Simple operations....
 
 Add: +
 Substract: -
 Multiply: *
 Divide: /
 
 Always take into account that the styles of the spaces between the numbers and the operators
 
 For example
 2 +6 // ERROR
 10 -2 //ERROR
 */

2 + 6

10 - 2

2 * 4

24 / 3

22 / 7 // 3 -> Swift always round the result down and always convert into integers

22.0 / 7.0 // when you are saying explicit to swift use decimal numbers

28 % 10 // modulo operation
