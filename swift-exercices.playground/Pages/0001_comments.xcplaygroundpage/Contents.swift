/*
 Code comments
 
 The Swift compiler generates executable code from your source code. To accomplish
 this, it usesa detailed set of rules you will learn about in this book. Sometimes
 these details can obscure the big picture of why you wrote your code certain way
 or even what problem you are solving. To prevent this, itÂ´s good to document what
 you wrote so that the next human who passes by will be able to make sense of your
 work. That next human, afetr all, may be a future you.
