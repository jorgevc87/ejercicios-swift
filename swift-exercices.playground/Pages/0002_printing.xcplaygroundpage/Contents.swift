/*
ItÂ´s also useful to see the results of what your code is doing. In Swift, you can
 achieve this through the use of the print command.
 
 Print will output whatever you want to the debug area (sometimes referred to as
 the console)
 
 For example, consider the following code:
 */

import Foundation

print("Hello, Swift apprentice reader")
