 Imagine new engineers join your team and have to change the basic functionallity of
 the module updating the logic. This change is risky since the engineers are not
 familiar with the code. An excellent way to prevent this from happening is to write
 unit tests
 
 Unit tests are blocks or code whose purpose is to test that your existing code
 works as espected.
